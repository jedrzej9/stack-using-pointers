# Stack implementation using void pointers

![Image of node structure](img/stack_1.png)

The project is about handling the stack. Stack handling is data type independent
as it relies on the use of void pointers. The functions that are available to
the user are: adding a new element (push), removing an element (pop), releasing
the stack (clear), displaying all stack elements (print stack), writing to a
binary file, reading from a binary file, searching the stack and terminating
program (finish).
